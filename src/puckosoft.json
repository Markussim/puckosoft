  "Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers",
  "Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers",
  "Microsoft ranked No.21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2016 and is considered one of the domestic Big Five technology companies",
  "Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of \"microcomputer software\") was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800",
  "It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows",
  "The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees",
  "Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011",
  "As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android",
  "The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio)",
  "Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy",
  "This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division",

  "However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android, because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones",
  "In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold",
  "This comparison, however, may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms",
  "Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to competitors) show one third market share, similar to that for end user use",
  "As of February 2020, the most recent version of Windows for PCs, tablets and embedded devices is Windows 10, version 2004",
  "The most recent version for server computers is Windows Server, version 2004",
